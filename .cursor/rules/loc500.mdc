Keep any file to be less than 500 lines of code.

If a file exceeds 500 lines of code - we have to refactor to either reusable components (astro, react, etc.) or utilities, libs, etc.

The only files that are allowed to be more than 500 lines of code are .html and .md and .mdx (astro static content pages).
